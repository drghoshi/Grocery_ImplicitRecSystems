# Introduction:

This repository contains code and data to help identify the best approaches to incorporate content-based features into an implicit-feedback based recommendation system. We'll be using the dataset that Instacart has released, found [here](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2),
containing ~3 million online grocery orders. Given a customer's previous orders, our goal is to predict the following order based on historical purchase information as well as product centered information.

# Background

Given how diverse and specific eating habits have become over the past few decades, it is imperative to serve recommendations that take into consideration dietary restrictions, personal preference as well as contextual information on products currently in cart. Since taste and preference in food are highly complex attributes, it makes sense that non-linear methods may learn the relationships more accurately. For this reason, we decided to combine neural-based approaches will collaborative filtering based approaches.
